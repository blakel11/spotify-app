# Angular Spotify Game

The game is simple a random letter from A-Z appears. The user types in the name of an artist or band that starts with that letter. Each successful answer results in a point added to the total score.

The application makes use of the handy 3rd Party Angular Service that queries the Spotify Web API upon each request through the form.
